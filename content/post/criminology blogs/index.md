title: Criminology blogs that inspired me
---

As one make way through graduate school and the field, there is so much to explore. Classes, conferences, seminars, supervisors tend to be  great sources but it is usually useful to go beyond them to get most out of it such as twitter, networking (and not being annoyed the word networking), extra curricular activities, hosting events, running a project etc. For me, criminology blogs functioned this purpose. Here is a neither comprehensive nor exhaustive list of these blogs that inspired me and provided most insight into academia;

https://rekadata.net/ by Dr. Reka Solymosi Lecturer in Quantitative Methods at the Department of Criminology at University of Manchester
https://andrewpwheeler.com/ by Dr. Andrew P. Wheeler former Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at University of Texas at Dallas
https://martinxandresen.wordpress.com/ by Dr. Martin A Andresen (also my former supervisor!) Associate Professor at Griffith University
https://www.jratcliffe.net/ by Dr. Jerry Ratcliffe who is a former British police officer and college professor
https://joenedelec.wixsite.com/joenedelec by Dr. Joseph L. Nedelec Associate Professor of Criminal Justice at University of Cincinnati


If you feel like your blog can be part of the list above, please just let me know.
