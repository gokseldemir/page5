I am currently a Ph.D. student at Simon Fraser University, School of Criminology. My broader interest in this field is grounded in statistical analysis and data visualization. More specifically, my research interest has two main elements; exploring individual pathways towards and from terrorism, and understading how those are linked to spatial and longitudinal patterns of recruitment to terrorist groups. I am also lucky to teach criminology and research method courses in several Canadian post secondary institutions.
